# Void Velocity

**Void Velocity** is a high-intensity space survival game built with React, TypeScript, and the HTML5 Canvas API. Pilot your custom shuttle through a dense asteroid field, manage your shield integrity, and blast your way through the cosmos while avoiding collision.

The game features real-time AI integration using **Google Gemini** to generate unique mission briefings and sarcastic crash reports based on your performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Fast-Paced Gameplay:** Dodge and weave through procedurally generated asteroid fields.
- **Level Progression System:**
  - Advance through 5 distinct sectors (e.g., "Sector Alpha", "Event Horizon").
  - **Difficulty Scaling:** Asteroids become faster and spawn more frequently as you level up.
  - **Hyperspace Jumps:** Intense visual transition sequences between levels.
- **Combat System:**
  - **Shields:** Manage your shield integrity. Small impacts drain shields; large impacts can be fatal.
  - **Weapons:** Collect weapon crates to upgrade from single-fire lasers to a tri-shot spread pattern.
- **Power-Ups:**
  - 🟡 **Fuel:** Boosts speed and score.
  - 🔵 **Shield Repair:** Restores hull integrity.
  - 🔴 **Weapon Upgrade:** Increases firepower.
- **Customization:** Choose your ship's chassis (Striker, Interceptor, Titan) and signature neon color in the Hangar.
- **AI-Powered Narratives:**
  - Dynamic **Mission Briefings** generated by Google Gemini API.
  - Personalized **Crash Reports** that analyze your survival time and score.
- **Immersive Audio:** Synthesized sound effects using the Web Audio API (no external assets required).
- **Visuals:**
  - 3D-rendered asteroid effects with directional lighting.
  - Dynamic proximity warning system (glows red when danger is near).
  - Parallax starfield background that reacts to warp speed.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Mouse / Touch:** Move the cursor or drag your finger to steer the ship. The ship follows your position horizontally.
- **Shooting:** The ship fires automatically. Collect red power-ups to increase fire rate and spread.
