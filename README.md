# Void Velocity

**Void Velocity** is a high-intensity space survival game built with React, TypeScript, and the HTML5 Canvas API. Pilot your custom shuttle through a dense asteroid field, manage your shield integrity, and blast your way through the cosmos while avoiding collision.

The game features real-time AI integration using **Google Gemini** to generate unique mission briefings and sarcastic crash reports based on your performance.
